## setup

if you just want to play mods, then download the [standalone builds](https://beatrixwashere.itch.io/modarchy); modarchy currently has support for windows, linux, and mac.

if you want to make mods or develop the tool, then download [godot 4.3](https://godotengine.org/download/) and clone this repository!

## features

**performance:** let's face it, flash can get *really* laggy sometimes. however, since we're switching from a decade old software to a modern game engine, we can get a massive boost in how well the game runs. even though rb1 is capped at 31 fps, you can theoretically get much higher than that, and maintain a consistent framerate.

**possibilities:** due to this switch, the options for what you can do with red ball modding are wide open. godot offers a ton of tools to suit your needs, and there's practically unlimited room to experiment and create whatever you want. there's already some really cool mods that show off how much potential this tool has for creating mods.

**accessibility:** godot uses a language named gdscript, which is basically a more specific version of python. additionally, godot has a wide variety of debugging tools, so you can pin down exactly what's going wrong. combined with the modarchy-specific tools here, the friction between making mods is reduced immensely.

## limitations

**accuracy:** even though it's close enough, this port isn't 100% accurate to the base game. however, a lot of the values are mirrored from the original games, and the physics are still deterministic.

**other ports unfinished:** as of right now, rb1 is the only game here that has been ported. the other games will be implemented into modarchy over the next few months. additionally, rb4 might not get modarchy ports out of legal concerns, but i still need to work that out.

**first steps:** since this tool is only a month old, there's still a lot of progress to be made. make sure to report any bugs you find in the discord server (linked near the top)!
