## THIS SCRIPT IS NOT MEANT TO BE USED, AND ONLY EXISTS SO THE MOD FOLDER IS INCLUDED IN THE EXPORT
# anyways make sure you keep all your mods in this folder!
# when you're making a mod, make a folder for it in here, and keep all your changes related to the mod in there
# contributions to the tool are very welcome, but make sure you don't structure them around your mod
# (by this i mean make sure they work for general cases, not specifically your mod)
# (and if you need to change files outside the mods folder then copy them into your mod and change them there)
# anyways have fun! ask me for help if you need it :3
